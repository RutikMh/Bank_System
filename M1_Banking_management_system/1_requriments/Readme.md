## Best methods followed
 * Used functions to decrease dependency on main function.
 * Used structures and arrays and sorting algorithms to accept the inputs from user and store the values which helped in creating easy design of Banking management system.
 * Printf statements have been placed only wherever necessary to avoid confusions.
 * Created header file so that the fuctions can be used else where ever required without any difficulty.
 * Unit testing is done to avoid any computational errors.
